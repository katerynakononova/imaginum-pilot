# Promptopia
This project introduces a novel platform for studying collective intelligence as it emerges in AI-driven creative environments. Drawing inspiration from the collaborative dynamics of projects like Reddit's r/Place and the VR-world co-created by NL12 | Lab VR with young artists in Kharkiv, Ukraine, this platform facilitates a unique form of community-driven art.
The system's innovation lies in two key features. First, participants contribute AI-generated content to a shared digital space. Second, the platform automatically organizes these contributions based on their semantic meaning, leading to the spontaneous formation of visual clusters. Thus, we can observe how collective imagination evolves in the context of indirect communication through AI. 
This process transforms the platform into a dynamic laboratory for observing how communities collaboratively build meaning and a shared consciousness. As a result, the project will not only generate a valuable dataset on collective behavior but also produce a constantly evolving audio-visual artwork that documents the community's creative journey.
